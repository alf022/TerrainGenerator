# TerrainGenerator
Terrain Generation Plugin. 

Only generates data, that can be used for building a level or terrain. The implementation of this depends completly up to you.
The data generated can be visualized in the Terrain Editor tool.

To see it working, just add the plugin to your project and rebuild it. It works out of the box using the debug data in the plugin content folder.
